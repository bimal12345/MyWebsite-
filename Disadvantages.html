                    body of your life and it will be fat. You will feel like shit and that's
                    not good for anyone. There might be people who get influenced by that body of yours.
                    But in the other hand if you are physically active you will influence your friends and
                    family to do the same thing.  Those are the reasons that you should not be fat. </p>
                                                                                              </section>
